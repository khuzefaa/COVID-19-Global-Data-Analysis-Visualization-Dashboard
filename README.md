# COVID-19-Global-Data-Analysis-Visualization-Dashboard
his comprehensive data science project provides an in-depth analysis of global COVID-19 pandemic data using Python and advanced data visualization techniques. The project leverages real-time data from Our World in Data to deliver actionable insights into pandemic trends, country-wise comparisons, vaccination progress, and epidemiological patterns.
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using real-time data from Our World in Data. The analysis covers global trends, country-specific patterns, vaccination progress, and key statistical insights from the pandemic's onset through the most recent available data.
The project is designed as an interactive Google Colab notebook that automatically fetches the latest COVID-19 data and generates professional visualizations and statistical summaries. It serves as both an educational resource for understanding pandemic data analysis techniques and a practical tool for monitoring global COVID-19 trends.
